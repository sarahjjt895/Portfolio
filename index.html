              <h2>Hello,</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                My name is Sarah, and I'm a UX/UI designer and front-end developer based in Sydney, Australia.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                I began my academic path after moving to Sydney, where I completed a Diploma of Interior Design &
                Decoration. Initially, I aimed to enter the world of architecture and design, but life had other plans.
                Drawn to the tech world, I taught myself to code and started creating prototypes and mockups of apps and
                web pages. This newfound passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Design Computing at the University of
                Sydney where I was able to turn ideas into reality from user research through to concept and later to
                high fidelity prototypes.
              </p>

            <div class="white-box5">
              <h2>A little bit of background...</h2>

              <br>
              <p>Since I can remember, I've always had a passion for creating and developing ideas. As a child, I
                enjoyed sketching and painting, and now, I design products for public consumption. During the pandemic,
                I
                learned to sew on my grandma's Elna. Inspired, I bought one for myself and began creating reusable
                fabric masks in custom designs. I advertised them and made them to order, to the point where strangers
                would ask where they were from when passing by, and make an order.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Recently, I launched my own Etsy store, where I sell a variety of designs, from pillows to printable
                event templates. Creativity is in my DNA, and I can't help but seek unmatched attention to detail in
                everything I make; I can demonstrate extensive patience when it comes to refining an idea. </p>
              <br>
              <p>I'm deeply fascinated with all aspects of the user experience, user research, user journey mapping, and
                visual design. I advocate for the user, ensuring that products meet their needs and are easy to use. My
                background in varied professional environments, as well as diverse lifestyle settings has allowed me to
                connect and understand users in a empathetic way, where I'm able to gain deep insights and user needs,
                leaving no stone unturned.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I am disciplined in a wide range of technical skills ranging from developing the front and back end of
                the website, prototyping with Balsamiq and Figma, and rendering illustrations and animations with Adobe
                PS,
                Illustrator, AfterEffects and too many more to mention.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
            <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I've developed a number of personal "side" projects over the years, including an Etsy store, creating and
              selling masks, interior design projects and some drawing and painting in my spare time. It brings me great
              joy and satisfaction to devise an idea, then bring it to life (and if people like my designs as much as I
              do, its an added bonus!). Feel free to peep my Etsy store if its something that might interest you.

          <h3>The Problem
          </h3>
          <p>Many running apps fail to fully meet the needs of avid runners, often lacking in customization,
            personalized feedback, and engaging features. Most current solutions provide basic tracking and goal-setting
            functionalities but fall short in delivering tailored insights or motivating content.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Runners are often left to settle for “good enough” rather than an app that truly enhances their training and
            performance.</p>

            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>The Rise of Fitness Tracking Apps</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the popularity of fitness tracking apps has surged. As of 2023, there are over 300,000
              health and fitness apps available on major platforms, compared to just 100,000 in 2018. This significant
              growth highlights a growing interest in health and wellness. Research shows that 80% of smartphone users
              have downloaded at least one health or fitness app, with 50% using them regularly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Among these, running
              apps have seen a substantial increase, with users seeking to monitor their performance, set goals, and
              improve their overall fitness.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="white-box-new2">
            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>On Track for Improvement</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The leading running apps (Nike Run Club, Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun) offer a range of features, but many
              still fall short in terms of personalization and user engagement. Typical features include:
              .</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>GPS tracking of runs</li>

              <li>Goal setting and achievement tracking</li>

              <li>Social sharing and community features</li>

              <li> Audio feedback and coaching</li>

              <li>Integration with wearables and other fitness devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, these apps often lack advanced personalization options, such as tailored training plans based on
              individual performance data, or in-depth analysis and feedback on running form and efficiency. Users also
              report a desire for more engaging and motivating content, such as challenges and virtual races.</p>

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>Understanding Needs and Preferences</h3>
            <p>To gain deeper insights into the needs and preferences of runners, I conducted one-on-one interviews with
              5 regular users of running apps. Additionally, I distributed a survey to 51 participants to validate these
              insights on a larger scale. Key findings from this research include:</p>
            <BR>
            <ul>
              <li>Users value detailed performance tracking but want more personalized insights and recommendations
                based on their data.</li>

              <li>While goal setting is popular, users seek more dynamic and adaptable goals that evolve with their
                progress.</li>

              <li>There is a strong demand for customizable training plans and the ability to tailor the app to
                individual needs and preferences.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

              I identified three key enhancements during my one-on-one interviews, which were later validated through
              surveys where participants could also suggest additional features. This process revealed five preferred
              features for a runner's app, with detailed performance tracking emerging as the most favored, followed by
              improved goal setting and personalized plans tailored to individual user needs.
