          <h2>Hello,</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            My name is Sarah, and I'm a UX/UI designer and front-end developer based in Sydney, Australia.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I began my academic path after moving to Sydney, where I completed a Diploma of Interior Design &
            Decoration. Initially, I aimed to enter the world of architecture and design, but life had other plans.
            Drawn to the tech world, I taught myself to code and started creating prototypes and mockups of apps and
            web pages. This newfound passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Design Computing at the University of
            Sydney where I was able to turn ideas into reality from user research through to concept and later to
            high fidelity prototypes.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="grey-section">
        <div class="white-box5">
          <h2>A little bit of background...</h2>

          <br>
          <p>Since I can remember, I've always had a passion for creating and developing ideas. As a child, I
            enjoyed sketching and painting, and now, I design products for public consumption. During the pandemic,
            I
            learned to sew on my grandma's Elna. Inspired, I bought one for myself and began creating reusable
            fabric masks in custom designs. I advertised them and made them to order, to the point where strangers
            would ask where they were from when passing by, and make an order.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Recently, I launched my own Etsy store, where I sell a variety of designs, from pillows to printable
            event templates. Creativity is in my DNA, and I can't help but seek unmatched attention to detail in
            everything I make; I can demonstrate extensive patience when it comes to refining an idea. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I'm deeply fascinated with all aspects of the user experience, user research, user journey mapping, and
            visual design. I advocate for the user, ensuring that products meet their needs and are easy to use. My
            background in varied professional environments, as well as diverse lifestyle settings has allowed me to
            connect and understand users in a empathetic way, where I'm able to gain deep insights and user needs,
            leaving no stone unturned.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am disciplined in a wide range of technical skills ranging from developing the front and back end of
            the website, prototyping with Balsamiq and Figma, and rendering illustrations and animations with Adobe
            PS,
            Illustrator, AfterEffects and too many more to mention.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="white-section">
        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I've developed a number of personal "side" projects over the years, including an Etsy store, creating and
          selling masks, interior design projects and some drawing and painting in my spare time. It brings me great
          joy and satisfaction to devise an idea, then bring it to life (and if people like my designs as much as I
          do, its an added bonus!). Feel free to peep my Etsy store if its something that might interest you.

          <h3>The Problem
          </h3>
          <p>Many running apps fail to fully meet the needs of avid runners, often lacking in customization,
            personalized feedback, and engaging features. Most current solutions provide basic tracking and goal-setting
            functionalities but fall short in delivering tailored insights or motivating content.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Runners are often left to settle for “good enough” rather than an app that truly enhances their training and
            performance.</p>

            <h3>MARKET RESEACH</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>The Rise of Fitness Tracking Apps</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the popularity of fitness tracking apps has surged. As of 2023, there are over 300,000
              health and fitness apps available on major platforms, compared to just 100,000 in 2018. This significant
              growth highlights a growing interest in health and wellness. Research shows that 80% of smartphone users
              have downloaded at least one health or fitness app, with 50% using them regularly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Among these, running
              apps have seen a substantial increase, with users seeking to monitor their performance, set goals, and
              improve their overall fitness.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="white-box-new2">
            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>On Track for Improvement</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The leading running apps (Nike Run Club, Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun) offer a range of features, but many
              still fall short in terms of personalization and user engagement. Typical features include:
              .</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>GPS tracking of runs</li>

              <li>Goal setting and achievement tracking</li>

              <li>Social sharing and community features</li>

              <li> Audio feedback and coaching</li>

              <li>Integration with wearables and other fitness devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, these apps often lack advanced personalization options, such as tailored training plans based on
              individual performance data, or in-depth analysis and feedback on running form and efficiency. Users also
              report a desire for more engaging and motivating content, such as challenges and virtual races.</p>

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>Understanding Needs and Preferences</h3>
            <p>To gain deeper insights into the needs and preferences of runners, I conducted one-on-one interviews with
              5 regular users of running apps. Additionally, I distributed a survey to 51 participants to validate these
              insights on a larger scale. Key findings from this research include:</p>
            <BR>
            <ul>
              <li>Users value detailed performance tracking but want more personalized insights and recommendations
                based on their data.</li>

              <li>While goal setting is popular, users seek more dynamic and adaptable goals that evolve with their
                progress.</li>

              <li>There is a strong demand for customizable training plans and the ability to tailor the app to
                individual needs and preferences.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

              I identified three key enhancements during my one-on-one interviews, which were later validated through
              surveys where participants could also suggest additional features. This process revealed five preferred
              features for a runner's app, with detailed performance tracking emerging as the most favored, followed by
              improved goal setting and personalized plans tailored to individual user needs.

          <h3>The Problem
          </h3>
          <p>In an increasingly digital world, concerns are rising over the detrimental effects of technology on mental
            and physical well-being. The widespread use of digital communication platforms, social media, and
            smartphones has reduced face-to-face interactions, leading to heightened social anxiety across all age
            groups. This is a significant issue, impacting personal relationships, professional growth, and overall
            mental health.

          <h2>Concept Development</h2>
          <p>Following the analysis of feedback from five expert usability tests conducted on the prototype, several
            critical issues have come to light. The application has been found to have shortcomings, such as screens
            lacking back buttons, and there is a need for an additional incentive system to motivate socially anxious
            individuals to engage in spontaneous challenges. </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            To address these concerns, actions were considered such as enhancing the standardization of back buttons,
            introducing a compelling incentive system (Feed), and ensuring button consistency. These measures aim to
            improve the overall usability and user satisfaction of the prototype, making it more engaging and effective
            for the target audience.</p>

          <p>The brief for this design was to create the branding and mobile app prototype for a fitness company of our
            choosing, I selected long boarding (a form of skating on a board). We were tasked with using multiple
            technical programs. Specifically, Adobe XD for wireframing and prototyping, Illustrator for icon and logo
            generation and AfterEffects for animating. All assets and illustrations within this project were illustrated
            by myself.

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>During initial ideation, I created wireframes and screens but realized they resembled countless other
            fitness apps. User research revealed a lack of options in existing apps that offered a holistic approach to
            covering all the needs of longboarders. This prompted me to rethink my approach and design an app that
            specifically addressed these unmet needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grey-box2">
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Based on user research, the app required a friends page for connecting and meeting up with fellow skaters,
            a spot-finding tool to locate smooth roads and assess hill intensities, and an e-commerce section for
            purchasing gear. These tailored features set the app apart from generic fitness apps, ensuring it meets the
            distinct needs of the long-boarding community.</p>

            integrated e-commerce and repair services.</p>
          <br>

              and tried to think of a problem I had recently encountered, where an app could provide the solution. This
              led me to the concept of an app that helps longboarders or cruisers find smooth roads that are easy to
              skate on, as well as identify the intensity levels of different hills on a map that can pinpoint their
              location. </p>

        <h2>Wireframe Prototype</h2>
        <p>I wanted the app to represent an easy-to-use interface, that had more than just a map for the users, so I
          added sections including a friends page (add friends, check their stats, find out if their cruising nearby for
          a meetup), shop for items like new boards, wheels etc., learn new tips and tricks, and check out inspiring
          skaters and cruisers.</p>
