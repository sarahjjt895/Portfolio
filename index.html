          <h3>The Problem
          </h3>
          <p>Many running apps fail to fully meet the needs of avid runners, often lacking in customization,
            personalized feedback, and engaging features. Most current solutions provide basic tracking and goal-setting
            functionalities but fall short in delivering tailored insights or motivating content.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Runners are often left to settle for “good enough” rather than an app that truly enhances their training and
            performance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="white-box2">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dynamically tailored training plans that adapt based on individual performance data and progress.</li>

            <li>Advanced Performance Insights that provide In-depth analysis and feedback on running form and
              efficiency.</li>

            <li>Dynamic Goals that adjust based on user progress to keep motivation high.</li>

            <li>Intuitive User Interface with seamless navigation and use across all devices.</li>

            <h3>MARKET RESEACH</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>The Rise of Fitness Tracking Apps</h3>
            <p>In recent years, the popularity of fitness tracking apps has surged. As of 2023, there are over 300,000
              health and fitness apps available on major platforms, compared to just 100,000 in 2018. This significant
              growth highlights a growing interest in health and wellness. Research shows that 80% of smartphone users
              have downloaded at least one health or fitness app, with 50% using them regularly. Among these, running
              apps have seen a substantial increase, with users seeking to monitor their performance, set goals, and
              improve their overall fitness.</p>

            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>On Track for Improvement</h3>
            <p>The leading running apps (Nike Run Club, Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun) offer a range of features, but many
              still fall short in terms of personalization and user engagement. Typical features include:
              .</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>GPS tracking of runs</li>

              <li>Goal setting and achievement tracking</li>

              <li>Social sharing and community features</li>

              <li> Audio feedback and coaching</li>

              <li>Integration with wearables and other fitness devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, these apps often lack advanced personalization options, such as tailored training plans based on
              individual performance data, or in-depth analysis and feedback on running form and efficiency. Users also
              report a desire for more engaging and motivating content, such as challenges and virtual races.</p>

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <h3>___________________</h3>
            <h3>Understanding Needs and Preferences</h3>
            <p>To gain deeper insights into the needs and preferences of runners, I conducted one-on-one interviews with
              5 regular users of running apps. Additionally, I distributed a survey to 51 participants to validate these
              insights on a larger scale. Key findings from this research include:</p>
              <BR>
            <ul>
              <li>Users value detailed performance tracking but want more personalized insights and recommendations
                based on their data.</li>

              <li>While goal setting is popular, users seek more dynamic and adaptable goals that evolve with their
                progress.</li>

              <li>There is a strong demand for customizable training plans and the ability to tailor the app to
                individual needs and preferences.</li>
              </ul>
